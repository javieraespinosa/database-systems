This course aims to introduce the use of **Modern Big Data technology** for processing data at scale on top of  distributed architectures (e.g., cluster-, cloud-based architectures).

Using the **Big Data life cycle** as reference (i.e., _data acquisition, storage, preparation, analysis, and visualization phases_), the course introduces the fundamental concepts at the core of existing Big Data technology and shows their practical application with concrete hands-on examples.

### Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be capable of:

* Define and illustrate with concrete examples the characteristics of Big Data (i.e., volume, velocity, and variety)

* Understand and configure the main components of a Modern Big Data platform for analytical operations

* Analyse large and heterogeneous datasets (structured, non-structured) on batch

### Methodology

The course follows the principle of blended learning. Students are thus expected to read and prepare using the provided online material before each lesson.

### Prerequisites

Students are expected to be familiar with the following topics:

* Fundamentals of (Relational) DBMS
* Fundamentals of Data Science
* Fundamentals of Distributed systems
* Fundamentals of Graphs and their associated operations

### Evaluation

* `60%` &emsp; exam + quizes
* `40%` &emsp; datathon + demofest
